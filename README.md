## My process
 It takes me a week maybe to learn this because when I started this challenge I haven't learn about CSS Flexbox
 so I need to learn that first and then finally I finished this after a week, it's a fun journey.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After completing this challenge I learned how to use flexbox and this is the code that I learn after completing this :

```css
#main-layout {
  display: flex;
  margin-top: 100px;
  min-height: 100%;
  width: 100vw;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue this journey with frontendmentor.io, it's so fun when you have a challenge and this is the best way not to stuck in "tutorial hell". Looking forward what I can until then.
